Your programs run and appear to produce correct results. I would however look over problem 2.3 again. You ended up with a height of 135 m giving a 1% difference in the final velocities of these dropped objects (an answer that is very wrong). However, you should not have compared your answer found from a differential solver to the "exact" solution - hitting the 1% threshold may have been an approximation artifact from the solver. You should compare solutions derived from the same method.
